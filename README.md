## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

This is a monorepo containing:

- **`/backend`** - Node.js/Express API server with TypeScript
- **`/frontend/app`** - React/TypeScript main application
- **`/frontend/landing`** - Marketing landing page
- **`/shared`** - Shared types and utilities

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Backend:**

- Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- Supabase (PostgreSQL database)
- OpenAI GPT-4 for AI responses
- Twilio for SMS messaging
- Socket.io for real-time features

**Frontend:**

- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- TailwindCSS for styling
- React Router for navigation

**Deployment:**

- Backend: Fly.io
- Frontend: Vercel
- Database: Supabase Cloud

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both `/backend` and `/frontend/app`
   - Configure Supabase, OpenAI, and Twilio credentials

3. **Start development servers:**

   ```bash
   # Backend (port 3000)
   cd backend && npm run dev

   # Frontend (port 5173)
   cd frontend/app && npm run dev
   ```
