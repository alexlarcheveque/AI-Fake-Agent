# Property Search Improvements

## Summary of Changes

We've significantly improved the property search functionality by implementing a structured data approach for extracting property search criteria from AI messages. This addresses the issue where property search criteria were not correctly updating in the backend.

## Key Improvements

1. **Structured Data Approach**: Instead of relying on complex regex parsing, we now use a structured JSON format (`NEW PROPERTY SEARCH: {...}`) that the AI assistant can output directly.

2. **Fallback Mechanisms**: For backward compatibility, we still support:
   - The original `NEW SEARCH CRITERIA:` format
   - Natural language parsing as a last resort

3. **Better Error Handling**: The system now has improved error handling and logging for property search operations.

4. **Periodic Refresh**: Added a mechanism to periodically check for updated property search criteria in messages.

5. **Standardized Property Fields**: Improved field naming and handling to support both `beds`/`bedrooms` and `baths`/`bathrooms` nomenclatures.

## Files Changed

- `frontend/src/api/propertySearchApi.ts` - Added `parseStructuredPropertySearch` function
- `frontend/src/components/MessageThread.tsx` - Updated to use structured data parsing
- Added documentation in `frontend/docs/PROPERTY_SEARCH_GUIDE.md`
- Added tests in `frontend/src/__tests__/propertySearchParser.test.js`

## Usage for AI Integration

The AI assistant should now be configured to include structured property search data in its responses using the format:

```
NEW PROPERTY SEARCH: {"minBedrooms": 4, "minBathrooms": 2.5, "minPrice": 500000, "maxPrice": 800000, "location": "Austin, TX"}
```

This format is much more reliable than trying to extract data from natural language, and it ensures that property search criteria will be correctly updated in the backend.

## Benefits

- More reliable property search criteria extraction
- Reduced code complexity
- Better user experience
- Easier maintenance
- Enhanced extensibility for future property criteria
