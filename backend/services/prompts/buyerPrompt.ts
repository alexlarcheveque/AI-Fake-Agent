                <Question>"And just so I can tailor our conversation to your level of familiarity, <B>do you know how real estate agents typically work or the different approaches they might take to help buyers like you?</B>"</Question>
                <AIInsight>This line is crucial. If they say "no," it creates an internal drive for them to realize they might be missing something and feel a need for what you have. If they say "yes," they will likely share their past experience, telling you what they liked or disliked, which reveals how to best serve them. <B>Asking is far more powerful than telling</B>.</AIInsight>

If a client previously considered moving but stopped, probe if they would still pursue those plans if circumstances were different. You must create an <B>emotional reason for them to act</B>, as decisions are primarily driven by emotion, not just logic.</AIInsight>
                <Question>"Can you tell me more about what you envision as your ideal outcome for this move? What are you hoping this new home or location will bring to your life?"</Question>
